## Keybinds: **DWM** Inspired
My keybinds (see [i3 config](https://github.com/dillacorn/deb12-i3-dots/blob/main/config/i3/config)) are heavily inspired by [**suckless DWM**](https://dwm.suckless.org/). Before switching to i3, I used [**DWM Flexipatch**](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch) by [bakkeby](https://github.com/bakkeby) â€” DWM was my first window manager.

## i3 Keybind Custom Scripts/Commands

Here are some of my custom keybinds from the i3 configuration:

- `mod4+shift+q` = **Reload i3 config**  
  - Reloads the current i3 configuration to apply any changes.
  - Additionally randomizes wallpaper in `~/Pictures/wallpapers` directory. <- if you don't want this behavior modify the ([i3 config](https://github.com/dillacorn/deb12-i3-dots/blob/main/config/i3/config)).
  
- `mod4+shift+r` = **Rotate i3 mod navigation**  
  - Switches between `mod1(alt)` and `mod4(win/super)` navigation using a script: [rotate_config_navigation.sh](https://github.com/dillacorn/deb12-i3-dots/blob/main/config/i3/scripts/rotate_config_navigation.sh).

- `mod1+ctrl+shift+p` = **i3 Power Menu**  
  - Activates Selectable Power Menu script: [i3exit.sh](https://github.com/dillacorn/deb12-i3-dots/blob/main/config/i3/scripts/i3exit.sh).
  - Escape(ESC) to cancel power menu.

- `mod4+shift+t` = **i3 Theme Changer**
  - Launches a theme selector using Rofi: [View avaliable theme scripts](https://github.com/dillacorn/deb12-i3-dots/tree/main/config/i3/themes).
  - You can easily add your own theme scripts to `~/.config/i3/themes`
  
- `mod4+shift+g` = **Capture a GIF**  
  - Starts a GIF recording with the script: [gif.sh](https://github.com/dillacorn/deb12-i3-dots/blob/main/config/i3/scripts/gif.sh).  
  - **Repeat the keybind to finish recording!**
  - `gif_date_time.gif` saved in `~/Videos` directory.
  
- `mod4+shift+s` = **Maim screenshot**  
  - Takes a screenshot using Maim.
  - `date_time.jpg` saved in `~/Pictures/screenshots` directory.

  - `date_time.png` normally saved in `~/Pictures/screenshots` directory.

## i3 Navigation

Here are more example keybinds from my i3 config:

Let me preface `"mod"` can equal `"mod1"` and/or `"mod4"` depending on [script navigation rotation](https://github.com/dillacorn/deb12-i3-dots/blob/main/config/i3/scripts/rotate_config_navigation.sh)

- `mod+shift+enter` = **Open Terminal**
  - Launches the terminal (default: Alacritty).

- `mod+p` = **Rofi Application Launcher**
  - Opens the Rofi app launcher for quick access to applications.

- `mod4+ctrl+shift+l` = **Lock Screen**
  - Locks the screen using `i3lock`.

- `mod+shift+c` = **Close Window**
  - Closes the focused window.

- `mod+f` = **Toggle Floating**
  - Toggles between tiling and floating window layouts.

- `mod+shift+f` = **Toggle Fullscreen**
  - Toggles app focus ~ fullscreen.

- `mod+arrow_keys` = **Change Focus**
  - Switch between open windows.

- `mod+shift+arrow_keys` = **Move Windows**
  - Move window location within workspace.

- `mod+mouse_1` = **Move Floating Window**
  - Move Floating Window with your mouse.

- `mod+mouse_2` = **Resize Floating Window**
  - Resize Floating Window with your mouse.

- `mod+1` to `mod+9` = **Workspace Switching**  
  - Switches to workspaces 1 through 9.

  - Moves the currently focused workspace to an adjacent monitor.

## TTY Setup: Ditch the Display Manager

I prefer using **TTY** instead of display managers like `gdm3`, `sddm`, or `lightdm`. To remove your display manager:

```sh
sudo apt remove gdm3 sddm lightdm
```

To login, type your username and password in TTY, then start i3 manually:

1. **Edit xinitrc**:
   ```sh
   micro /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
   ```
   Match my [xinitrc](https://github.com/dillacorn/deb12-i3-dots/blob/main/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc).

2. **Start i3**:
   ```sh
   startx
   ```

3. **Troubleshooting**:
   If you encounter any issues, switch between TTYs using `CTRL+ALT+F1` to `F6`.

### Why I Prefer TTY:
When you logout of i3, any errors in your config or applications will be shown directly in the **TTY**, making it easier to troubleshoot.

### Installing i3-WM and Related Applications with Scripts

To install the applications I use with i3, you can run my [install script](https://github.com/dillacorn/deb12-i3-dots/blob/main/scripts/install_my_i3_apps.sh). This script installs essential tools like i3-wm, Rofi, Dunst, and more.

For Flatpak applications, run the [install_my_flatpaks.sh script](https://github.com/dillacorn/deb12-i3-dots/blob/main/scripts/install_my_flatpaks.sh) to set up additional software.

### P.S.
This repository originally began as a Wayland-focused project (see the git history). However, X11 currently offers greater flexibility in customization. My goal is to learn as much as I can with X11, with the hope that this knowledge can eventually be applied to a separate repository using Sway-wm.

At present, i3-wm seems more flexible (especially for gaming), but with ongoing developments and updates in the unstable repositories, it's likely that the gap will eventually close, and we may all need to transition to a Wayland-based window manager.
