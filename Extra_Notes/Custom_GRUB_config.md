# I've been annoyed by grub auto-selecting the newely install Debian kernal.

### Edit grub config

```sh
sudo micro /etc/default/grub
```

### comment out default GRUB selection line.

```sh
# GRUB_DEFAULT=0
```

### add save last boot kernal
```sh
# Save last selected kernal
GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true
```

#### I prefer this boot configuration because when a new kernal is released GRUB is selecting the new default Debian kernal even though I want to use the older custom "linux-tkg" kernal I selected previously...
