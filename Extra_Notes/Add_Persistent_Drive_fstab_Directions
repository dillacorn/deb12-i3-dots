list drives.

`sudo blkid`

edit fstab.

**Warning: If you mess up fstab your system will have issues starting. You will need to reboot into recovery mode and use "micro" to edit fstab again to fix the issues you may have caused.**

`sudo micro /etc/fstab`

Create a new line at the end starting with "#" - add description for auto-mounting directory.

***example:***
`# secondary M.2 drive /dev/nvme1n1p1`
`UUID=e9d89909-b5b1-49e5-90b1-279004892fz21    /media/dillacorn/M2   ext4   defaults   0   2`

save and reboot.

Check that your drive has auto-mounted with your favorite file manager. - I use "pcmanfm"
